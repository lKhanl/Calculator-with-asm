# Calculator-with-asm

Objective = Become familiar with Interrupts and Emulation Kit. \
Work = Write an assembly program that is able to add, subtract, multiply or divide two 8-bit numbers which are given by the user via emulator screen. 
1. Get the first operand from user. Read the characters (only between ‘0’ and ‘9’) until “enter” key is pressed. There is no need to check if
the given number exceeds the 8-bit (above 255).
2. Get the second operand as described in Step 1.
3. Get the operator from user. Program must accept only 4 basic arithmetic operators which are ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’. If any other key is pressed, the program must display a message and ask for the operator again until a correct key is pressed.
4. When two operands and the operator is available, the program calculates the corresponding result and prints the result on ASCII LCD Display Output.
